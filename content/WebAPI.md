# Overview

The Junction API consists of a set of callable actions.

To perform an action, you need to send a request specifying an action and some parameters. 

In return, you will recieve a formatted response.

The REQUIRED parameter `Action` is used to specify the requested action.

All actions take a list of named parameters.

The parameters and resulting responses for each action are listed on the action's spec page.

If you have any problems or requests please contact [support][].
