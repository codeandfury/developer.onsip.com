## User Address Add

Every user can have one or more user addresses or SIP addresses (e.g mike@acme.onsip.com). This feature can be a useful way to create different identities like mike.sales@acme.onsip.com and mike.support@acme.onsip.com for the same user. User addresses can be a handy feature when used in conjunction with [Ring Groups](../Ring-Groups). For instance, it would be trivial to run phone campaigns by placing the user address, mike.campaign1@acme.onsip.com, into the [Ring Group](../Rign Groups) holiday.campaign1@acme.onsip.com, and then assigning a phone number to that campaign.
